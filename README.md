#####Welcome to dev’s codealongs! Where developers hack through speed dating and find that perfect coding partner they have always dreamed about.

#####Whether you’re developing a friendship, co-partner, or more, dev codealongs is a great way to meet coders like you and develop relationships while programming.

#####Each “codealong” is developer dating orientated, which means each codealong will be a language based meetup with a speed dating theme.
